# To run "backend project" in Android Studio

Go to terminal, then run:
./gradlew appengineDownloadSdk

# Android Studio seems to complain about "JokerApi" symbol
The symbol will be generated at build time, so everything will (hopefully) work in the end.

Just run the backend project first, then the app project.
